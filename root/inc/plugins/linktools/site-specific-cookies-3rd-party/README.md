## Custom Site-Specific Cookie Files

Admins and third-party developers extending Link Tools can use this directory to store site-specific cookie files which append to (and override when in conflict with) the ../site-specific-cookies.php file. See the comments at the top of that file for the purpose, format, and interpretation of these files.
